## The technologies a used: 
- React
- Styled Components

## Some thoughts on it: 
Used this project mainly to practice building some more general layout components (Box, Flex, Typography, Container...), like what we have in Material UI or Chakra UI. But of course, there is still a lot to improve over the time.
